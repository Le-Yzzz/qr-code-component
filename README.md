## My process

I started with mobile version first and worked my way up. I've seen a lot of people work this way and i thought i'd give it a go. I used flexbox to keep everything centered rather than using `margin:auto;`.

[Update] I switched to desktop version first. I find it a lot easier to style the whole thing once and then adjust it on mobile version.

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Visual Studio Code
